Experimentation low relax on 16th Feb 2020
================================
1. change the ocean depth from 150m to ~500m
    --- the experiment last time indicates that 150m is too shallow
2. change the ocean width from 85W-85E to 128W-128E
    --- the experiment last time indicates a very strong boundary flow.
3. change the radiation relaxation time.
    --- so that the surface temperature distribution might be different.
